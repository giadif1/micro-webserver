This webserver targets the .NET Micro Framework (NETMF).  It supports static and dynamic web pages as well as restfull web services.  A sample project is provided in the solution

The MicroWebserver has been developed on GHI Electronics' Cobra hardware but should be easy to port to other hardware.

Documentation for the project is still work in progress.  Please check out the sample project included in the solution for ideas.  The basics of the sample project are explained in the SampleProjectExplained wiki page.  Feel free to contact me if you have questions or comments.  Development assistance is, of course, welcome.
